# UnitConverter

A basic unit converter that introduced me to the world of Android Development. Through this project,
I explored the fundamentals of Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, gaining hands-on experience with
essential concepts in modern Android app development.

## What I Learned

This project helped me understand and apply the following key concepts:

### **Kotlin Fundamentals**

- Variables and data types
- Functions and scope
- Mutable and immutable states
- Null safety and safe calls

### **Jetpack Compose Basics**

- Understanding `@Composable` functions
- State management using `remember` and `mutableStateOf`
- Building UI with `Column`, `Row`, `Box`, and other layout components
- Handling user input with `OutlinedTextField`
- Using `DropdownMenu` for unit selection
- Applying `MaterialTheme` for UI consistency

### **Event Handling and State Updates**

- Managing UI state dynamically
- Reacting to user input changes
- Updating computed values based on selection and input

## Features

- Converts units between **Centimeters, Meters, Feet, and Millimeters**
- Real-time conversion as the user inputs values
- Dropdown menus for selecting input and output units
- Simple and intuitive UI using Jetpack Compose

## Future Improvements

- Add more unit types (weight, temperature, volume, etc.)
- Improve UI design with animations and custom styling
- Implement better error handling for invalid inputs
- Introduce a history feature to track past conversions

## Installation Guide

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/UnitConverter.git
   ```
2. Open the project in **Android Studio**
3. Ensure you have the latest **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose** dependencies installed
4. Run the project on an emulator or a real device
